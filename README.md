# Human-Activity-Recognition

This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying using readings from the sensors on a smartphone carried by the user.

## About the Dataset

We have used the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set** on the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones). </br>
This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

### How the Data was Recorded

By using the sensors(Gyroscope and accelerometer) in a smartphone, they have captured '3-axial linear acceleration'(_tAcc-XYZ_) from accelerometer and '3-axial angular velocity' (_tGyro-XYZ_) from Gyroscope with several variations. 

> **prefix 't' in those metrics denotes time.**

> **suffix 'XYZ' represents 3-axial signals in X , Y, and Z directions.**

### Feature Names

1. These sensor signals are preprocessed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width windows(sliding windows) of 2.56 seconds each with 50% overlap. ie., each window has 128 readings. 

2. From Each window, a feature vector was obtianed by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
> In our dataset, each datapoint represents a window with different readings 
3. The accelertion signal was saperated into Body and Gravity acceleration signals(___tBodyAcc-XYZ___ and ___tGravityAcc-XYZ___) using some low pass filter with corner frequecy of 0.3Hz.

4. After that, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtian _jerk signals_ (___tBodyAccJerk-XYZ___ and ___tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ___). 

5. The magnitude of these 3-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidian norm. This magnitudes are represented as features with names like _tBodyAccMag_, _tGravityAccMag_, _tBodyAccJerkMag_, _tBodyGyroMag_ and _tBodyGyroJerkMag_.

6. Finally, We've got frequency domain signals from some of the available signals by applying a FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). These signals obtained were labeled with ___prefix 'f'___ just like original signals with ___prefix 't'___. These signals are labeled as ___fBodyAcc-XYZ___, ___fBodyGyroMag___ etc.,.

	+ ___correlation()___: correlation coefficient between two signals
	+ ___maxInds()___: index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
	+ ___meanFreq()___: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

	+ ___kurtosis()___: kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
	+ ___bandsEnergy()___: Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
	+ ___angle()___: Angle between to vectors.

9. We can obtain some other vectors by taking the average of signals in a single window sample. These are used on the angle() variable'
